I once thought Prolog was poorly standardised,   but  now I know better.
SQL is very poorly standardised.

Microsoft SQL Server
====================

    * If you want to use the option source(true) to get the table-name
      in the result-set, you must use add 'FOR BROWSE' at the end of the
      SQL SELECT statement.  Read more in

	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odbcsql/od_odbc_c_9qp1.asp

    * To allow multiple active statements, use

	odbc_set_connection(Connection, cursor_type(dynamic))
